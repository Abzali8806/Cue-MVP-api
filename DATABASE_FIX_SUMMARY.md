# FastAPI Database Configuration Fix - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Supabase Configuration
- **File**: `config.py`
- **Change**: Removed `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_API_KEY` settings that were causing the connection to the remote Supabase database
- **Impact**: Eliminates the source of the connection error to `db.aanaancudogzhbapedtp.supabase.co`

### 2. Enhanced Docker Compose Configuration
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- **Changes**:
  - Explicitly set `ENVIRONMENT=development` in the app service
  - Added explicit database and Redis connection environment variables
  - Added Redis service dependency to the app service
  - Ensured all environment variables are properly passed to the container

### 3. Created Environment Configuration Files
- **File**: `.env` (for actual use)
- **File**: `.env.example` (template for others)
- **Purpose**: Provides clear environment variable configuration for local development

### 4. Validated Configuration
- ✅ Docker Compose YAML syntax is valid
- ✅ Python syntax is correct for all main files
- ✅ No remaining Supabase references found in codebase
- ✅ Database and Redis connections properly configured for local services

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was occurring because:
1. The application was trying to connect to a Supabase database URL that was hardcoded in the configuration
2. Even though the default `DATABASE_URL` was set correctly for local PostgreSQL, there might have been an environment variable override
3. The docker-compose configuration wasn't explicitly setting the database connection parameters

## How to Run the Fixed Application

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Cue-MVP-api
   ```

2. **Build and start the services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050 (admin@cue.local / admin123)
   - Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health

4. **Stop the services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Environment Variables

The application now uses these local service connections:
- **Database**: `postgresql://cue_user:cue_password@db:5432/cue_development`
- **Redis**: `redis://redis:6379/0`

## Next Steps

1. Test the application by running `docker-compose up --build`
2. Verify the health check endpoint returns successful database and Redis connections
3. Configure OAuth credentials in the `.env` file if needed for authentication features
4. Update any frontend applications to point to the correct backend URL

## Files Modified

1. `config.py` - Removed Supabase configuration
2. `docker-compose.yml` - Enhanced environment variable configuration
3. `.env` - Created local environment configuration
4. `.env.example` - Created environment template

The application should now connect properly to the local PostgreSQL and Redis instances defined in your docker-compose configuration.
